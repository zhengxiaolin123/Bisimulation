										the VLTS benchmark suite</a>
								</h3>
								<div class="level3">
									<p>The VLTS acronym stands for "Very Large Transition Systems".</p>
										<p>The VLTS benchmark suite is a collection of Labelled
										Transition Systems (hereafter called benchmarks). Each
										Labelled Transition System is a directed, connected graph,
										whose vertices are called states and whose edges are called
										transitions. There is one distinguished vertex called the
										initial state. Each transition is labelled by a character
										string called action or label. There is one distinguished
										label noted "i" that is used for so-called invisible
										transitions (also known as hidden transitions or
										tau-transitions). </p>
										<p>The VLTS benchmarks have been obtained from
										various case studies about the modelling of communication
										protocols and concurrent systems. Many of these case studies
										correspond to real life, industrial systems.</p>

										benchmark suite</a>

								</h3>
								<div class="level3">
									<p>
										The VLTS benchmark suite is designed to be a reference
										criterion for scientific assessment of algorithms and tools
										operating on large graphs. In particular, this encompasses
										algorithms and tools for explicit state verification of
										concurrent systems, including:
										<ul>
											<li>model checkers,</li>
											<li>equivalence checkers (comparison and minimization tools,
												etc.),</li>
											<li>graph visualization tools,</li>
											<li>formats for representing transitions systems,</li>
											<li>etc.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Algorithms and tools operating on more general graphs than
										transition systems may also benefit from the VLTS benchmark
										suite by simply discarding label information attached to
										transitions. The need for the VLTS benchmark suite was
										recognized in several places, e.g., by Agostino Dovier, Carla
										Piazza, and Alberto Policriti in their CAV'2001 paper ("A Fast
										Bisimulation Algorithm"):<p>
										  <p> <em>To the best of our knowledge
											there is no `official' set of benchmarks for testing an
											algorithm such as the one we propose in our paper. We decided
											to test our implementation in the context of formal
											verification using model checkers and considering the
											transition graphs they generate from a given program [...].
											Usually, the graphs generated consist of a unique strongly
											connected component and the set of possible labels is huge. </em></p>

                                      <p>
										The VLTS benchmark suite intends to fill this gap by providing
										a comprehensive set of benchmarks. We hope that it will be as
										useful as other standard benchmarks, such as those developed,
										e.g., to assess Binary Decision Diagrams packages.

								<div class="level3">
									<p>All the graphs are encoded in the <em>BCG</em> (Binary-Coded Graphs)
										format, then compressed using the bzip2 tool. To our
										knowledge, this is up to now the most compact way for storing
										Very Large Transition Systems.</p>
										 <p>First, we should make sure
										that us are working on a machine with enough free disk space
										available (at least 500 megabytes, 1 gigabyte to be safe). You
									    should have already the CADP tools installed on your
										machine, registrate from <a href="http://cadp.inria.fr/registration/">CADP</a>. 
										After downloading a graph,
										say "graph.bcg.bz2", from the Table below, you must first
										uncompress it using the bunzip2 tool:  <em> bunzip2</em>
										graph.bcg.bz2 This will produce a BCG graph named "graph.bcg".
										You can read and process "graph.bcg" from a computer program
										in two different ways: You can use the bcg_read API
										(Application Programming Interface), which provides a simple
										set of functions for handling BCG graphs. You will have to
										link your computer program against the BCG binary libraries.</p>

										<p>
										You can use the <em>bcg_io</em> tool, which converts BCG graphs into a
										dozen of other formats (mostly textual formats). To avoid disk
										space overflow, it is recommended to use this tool in pipe
										mode, so that the converted graph is not written to disk. For
										instance: <em>bcg_io graph.bcg -aldebaran - | more Note:</em>
										In addition to the VLTS benchmarks, you might be interested by
										the various classes of `regular' benchmarks produced by the
										bcg_graph tool.</p>
