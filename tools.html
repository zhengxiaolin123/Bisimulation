								<p>CADP("Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes",
									formerly known as "CAESAR/ALDEBARAN Development Package") is a
									popular toolbox for the design of asynchronous concurrent
									systems, such as communication protocols, distributed systems,
									asynchronous circuits, multiprocessor architectures, web
									services, etc.</p>
								<p>CADP offers a wide set of functionalities, ranging from
									step-by-step simulation to massively parallel model-checking.
									It is the only toolbox to offer:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Compilers for several input formalisms, e.g.:
										<ul>
											<li>High-level descriptions written in various languages,
												such as LOTOS (ISO International Standard 8807), LNT, FSP,
												pi-calculus, etc. The CADP toolbox provides compilers
												(CAESAR, CAESAR.ADT, LNT2LOTOS, FSP2LOTOS, etc.) that
												translate high-level descriptions into C code to be used for
												simulation, verification, and testing purposes;</li>
											<li>Low-level descriptions specified as automata (i.e.,
												finite state machines) and networks of communicating
												automata that run in parallel, synchronize, and communicate
												using process algebra operators or synchronization vectors.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Several equivalence checking tools (minimization and
										comparisons modulo bisimulation relations), such as BCG_MIN
										and BISIMULATOR.</li>
									<li>Several model-checkers for various temporal logic and
										mu-calculus, such as EVALUATOR and XTL.</li>
									<li>Several verification algorithms combined together:
										enumerative verification, on-the-fly verification, symbolic
										verification using binary decision diagrams, compositional
										minimization, partial orders, distributed model checking, etc.
									</li>
									<li>Plus a bunch of other tools with advanced functionalities
										such as visual checking, performance evaluation, etc.</li>

								</ul>
								<p>CADP is designed in a modular way and puts the emphasis on
									intermediate formats and programming interfaces (such as the
									BCG and OPEN/CAESAR software environments), which allow the
									CADP tools to be combined with other tools and adapted to
									various specification languages.</p>

									BCG format</a>
							</h3>
							<div class="level3">
								<p>bcg, BCG - Binary Coded Graphs: binary file format for
									labelled transition systems</p>
								<p>The acronym BCG stands for Binary Coded Graphs. It refers
									both to a format and a software environment. The BCG format is
									a computer representation for labelled transition systems,
									Kripke structures, and, more generally, state/transition models
									(hereafter called graphs) which are generated from higher-level
									models of concurrent systems. Compared to other existing
									formats with similar purposes, the BCG format combines several
									advantages:</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>The BCG format is independent from any particular
											model-based verification technique; it can be used either by
											tools performing graph comparison and reduction modulo
											equivalence relations, or by tools checking properties
											expressed in temporal logics. It can also be used in other
											contexts: graph exploration, graph drawing, etc.</li>
										<li>The BCG format is independent from the language used to
											describe the concurrent system to be analyzed. It was
											designed so as to allow the representation of graphs
											generated from various concurrent languages.</li>
										<li>The BCG format provides sophisticated mechanisms to keep
											track of source-level information. This is especially useful,
											since it is possible to establish a connection between the
											behaviour of a BCG graph and the source program from which
											the BCG graph was generated.</li>
										<li>The BCG format uses a binary representation of the LTS
											together with ad-hoc compression algorihms, leading to very
											compact files. Graphs with millions of states and transitions
											can be represented using only a few megabytes of disk space.
										</li>

									</ul>

								</p>
								<p>Moreover, the BCG format is supported by an efficient and
									extensive software implementation, the BCG environment.</p>

								<p>
									In the BCG environment, the programs dealing with graphs
									encoded in the BCG format are called ``application tools''.
									These programs can be either binary programs or shell-scripts.<a
